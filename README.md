# MEAN Stack RESTful API  - Registration System | Registration Desk 
<h2>MEAN Stack RESTful API - Registration Desk</h2>


This repo contains the code for a RESTful API Registration System that was built using the MEAN stack:

<ul>
<li>MongoJs(nodeJs module)</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

If you have trouble with the tutorial (especially since I had to modify the code due to an AngularJS update), simply clone this repo using 

    git clone https://github.com/avmadhukiran/Registration-System.git
then install the Node modules with

    npm install

<h3>Have fun!</h3>
